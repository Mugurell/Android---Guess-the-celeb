Cool guess the celeb Android app.


[![Guess the celeb](http://oi64.tinypic.com/30cwuub.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MM9-55EOck "Guess the celeb")



Works by downloading the html code from http://www.posh24.com/celebrities , extract the relevant data using regexes - names and images of the celebs and then.. hope you like the result.

Was a fun app to work on, having tackled:
  - downloading from the internet on another thread using AsyncTask
  - use of regexes
  - saving/retrieving data from device's internal memory
  - working with dialogs, notifications
  - use of toolbar and snackbar with custom styles

All in all a cool app anyway you look at it.
